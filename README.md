# Quicklist (GNOME Shell extension)

A [GNOME Shell extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/about/) which adds
dynamic quicklists to app icons' menu:

- file manager bookmarks (for Nautilus, Nemo, Caja or Thunar) ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/dpXxtOS.jpg))
- recent files openable by the application ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/UPSssDJ.jpg))

**Warning:** this is not compatible with *Dash-To-Dock* or *Ubuntu-Dock*
**thumbnail previews** (it works with *Dash to panel*, or with a dock without
thumbnail previews, or with a normal GNOME Shell dash).

Available in Dutch, French, Polish and English.
