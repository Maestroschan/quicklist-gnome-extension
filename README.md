# Quicklist (GNOME Shell extension)

A [GNOME Shell extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/about/) which adds dynamic quicklists to app icons' menu:

- bookmarks (for Nautilus or Nemo) ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/dpXxtOS.jpg))
- recent files openable by the application ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/UPSssDJ.jpg))

**Warning:** this is not compatible with Dash-To-Dock or Ubuntu-Dock thumbnail previews.

Available in french and english.

## Installation

Download files and put them in a "`quicklists@maestroschan.fr`" folder, in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`

You may need to restart the gnome shell environnment ("logout and login again", or alt + f2 + `r` + enter).

Then activate it (with GNOME Tweaks, or from GNOME Software, or directly launch `gnome-shell-extension-prefs`).
